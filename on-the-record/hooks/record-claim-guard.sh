# PreToolUse (Write|Edit|MultiEdit): deny-only, session-side mirror of
# gates.py's record-claim-integrity checks (issue #457, porting Group A+B
# of docs/issue-457/proposals/2026-08-08-gate-porting-order.md).
#
# gates.py runs these as CI diff-scans against a whole PR; a PreToolUse
# hook only ever sees one write's resulting content, so this is a
# write-time approximation of the same intent, not a byte-identical port:
# catch the claim shape at the moment it is typed, instead of at PR-review
# time days later (#332's generator point).
#
# Ported checks, all scoped to writes under docs/issue-*/reports/** or
# work/docs/issue-*/reports/** (a role's own record):
#   - #333 mirror: a bare "N of M"/"N items" count claim with no code-fence
#     reproduction and no `derived: ...` citation.
#   - #310 mirror: an `unverifiable:` escape line with no reason text.
#   - #331 mirror: an `Acceptance verification` "checked: X — result: ..."
#     line whose result is `unverifiable` but carries no reason.
#   - #330 mirror: a backtick-quoted relative path referenced in the new
#     content that does not exist anywhere in the working tree — an
#     orphaned reference caught at write time instead of PR review.
#   - #793 mirror (verify-before-claim): a role-output / session-PR-board
#     state / defect claim line with no `canonical: <what was read>` tag
#     within 3 lines above it — a claim citing only a summary, grep, or
#     watcher signal with nothing canonical named.
#   - #870 mirror (generalized fake-success detection, candidate (a)): an
#     OUTCOME claim ("requirement(s) met"/"done"/"PASS(es/ed)"/
#     "complete(d)") needs its `canonical:` citation to itself be an
#     executed-live reference (a command string, or an
#     `acceptance: <command> — result: ...` line) — a bare file-read
#     citation satisfies #793's own check but not this one.
#   - #791 mirror (read-before-claim grounding): a defect/root-cause
#     claim line needs a verbatim (whitespace-normalized) fenced quote
#     matching the cited file:line range, or a `derived: <command>`
#     reproduction — a bare grep/keyword hit is not sufficient evidence.
#
# Fails closed (trap remaps non-0/2 exit to 2), matching this plugin's
# house style. Kill switch: ORCHESTRATE_OFF=1.
#
# issue #517: the four checks below used to carry their own regex copies
# here. They now call into gates/record_lint.py's functions — the same
# ones `record_lint`'s CLI and gates/ci.py use — so there is exactly one
# place each rule's logic lives.
