# PreToolUse (Bash): deny-before-effect gate on gh pr merge — issue #441.
#
# Zero-install baseline (contract, not CI-supplement): this script ships
# with the plugin like deliverable-guard.sh; it needs no gates/ checkout in
# the consumer repo, only `gh` on PATH, because the checks it runs
# (ci.py/pr_reference.py/closure_sweep.py single-PR case/landing_readiness.py
# per the proposal's item-1 table, docs/issue-441/proposals/
# 2026-08-07-contract-enforcement-boundary.md) are all read-only `gh`
# lookups against GitHub, not local-checkout diffs.
#
# Scope: intercepts only `gh pr merge` (the delivering act). It folds in
# the phase-2 "Closes/Fixes/Resolves #<issue>" requirement (pr_reference.py
# phase2 path, closure_sweep.py single-PR case's specific violating act) —
# the requirement a consumer without any local install would otherwise
# never see enforced at all. Phase is determined the same way
# gates/ci.py._approved_roles_on_issue does: an `APPROVE issue-<n>/<role>`
# comment from an approvers.md account on the issue means phase-2.
#
# Fail-open by design difference from deliverable-guard.sh: deliverable-guard
# denies WRITES (cheap to re-attempt, high blast radius if wrong-allowed).
# This gates a PR MERGE (expensive to undo, and `gh`/network failures are
# common in sandboxed sessions) — so a lookup failure here is reported and
# passed through rather than blocking an unrelated command. What must never
# happen is silently approving a merge this script positively determined
# violates the contract; that path is the only one that exits 2.
