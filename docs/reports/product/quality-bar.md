- 2026-08-25: operator-frozen constraint on infrastructure/tooling fixes to
  on-the-record itself (issues touching spawn.py/pipeline.py/skills.py/
  gates/hooks, not target-repo deliverables): a fix must hold systemically
  for every session that installs on-the-record and works against any
  target repo, not just the self-hosted checkout, and must land without
  side effects — no added per-spawn overhead or steady-state load, no new
  conflict surfaces (append-log or otherwise), no stall/deadlock modes, no
  consumer-tree pollution. Reviewers grade against this bar directly: a
  delivery that works on the self-hosted checkout but adds overhead, a new
  contention point, or consumer-visible residue elsewhere does not meet it.
  Where a trade-off is unavoidable, it must be measured and stated in the
  record at delivery time, not discovered later. Source: operator comment
