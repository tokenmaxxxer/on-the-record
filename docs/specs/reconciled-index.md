# Reconciled spec index

Issue #336: several repos build against this engine's spec, but no
document lists or hashes the others, so contradictions between
documents survive indefinitely. This file is the single reconciled
reading — every spec-shaped document, its recorded content hash, and
(below) the ambiguities already found and resolved.

`gates/spec_index.py` recomputes each listed file's SHA256 and fails
when it no longer matches what's recorded here. Regenerate with
`python3 gates/spec_index.py --update` after reading what changed and
updating "Resolved ambiguities" if the edit touches a resolved point.

## Resolved ambiguities

- **Ledger storage location.** Canonical storage is `runs/ledger.jsonl`
  (per `docs/handbooks/operations.md:159,405`,
  `docs/specs/flows-schema.md:243-252`, and
  `on-the-record/commands/run.md:340`, all of which agree).
  `ledger/collect.py` (repo-root script) is an aggregator that *reads*
  `runs/ledger.jsonl` — it is not itself the storage location.
  `docs/handbooks/on-the-record.md`'s architecture diagram previously
  labeled `ledger/` as "the scorecard" without naming it as an
  aggregator, which read as if `ledger/` were the storage; corrected in
  this change (both the Korean and English diagram lines) to name it as
  the aggregator over `runs/ledger.jsonl`. `protocol.md` does not
  mention the ledger at all and is not in contradiction with the above —
  it is simply silent on this topic.
