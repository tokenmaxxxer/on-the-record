# Contract enforcement boundary

Every `gates/*.py` module, every `on-the-record/hooks/*.sh` script, and
every `.github/workflows/*.yml` workflow in this repository must have a
row below with a recorded verdict. `gates/test_boundary.py` fails the
build if one is added or renamed with no row here — the boundary is
derived from this file's completeness against the filesystem, not
maintained by hand elsewhere (#333, #376).

Verdict values:
- `contract` — enforces an obligation `run.md` states on a consumer's role
  session; must be reachable by a consumer.
- `contract, CI-supplement` — contract-bound, but its violating act is only
  reachable via the CI supplement (not built in this delivery; see the
  proposal), because the zero-install baseline (plugin hooks + `spawn.py`)
  cannot see it.
- `out of scope — operator decision, 2026-08-07` — detecting already-drifted
  state was explicitly ruled out of scope for issue #441 (operator's
  approval-comment follow-up on that issue); this is a drawn boundary, not
  an unmet obligation. Narrowed by issue #464's ADR
  (`docs/issue-464/decisions/2026-08-08-board-state-into-orchestrator-loop.md`):
  the `closure_sweep.py`/`spawn_coverage.py` board-wide cases are reversed
  (see the `contract, orchestrator-loop` rows below) — #312/#388/#407 stay
  under this original ruling, untouched.
- `contract, orchestrator-loop` — board-wide (multi-subject) case enforced
  zero-install via `spawn.py:roster_watchdog()`'s per-tick sweep call,
  reachable by any consumer running the orchestrator loop; observe-only,
  per issue #464.
- `repo-local` — checks this repository's own source/process, not a
  consumer's; no obligation to reach consumers.
- `n/a (infrastructure)` — router, dispatcher, or read-only feed with no
  standalone clause of its own.

## `gates/*.py`

| mechanism | verdict | reason |
|---|---|---|
| `ci.py` | contract | enforced zero-install via `contract-guard.sh` (phase-2 Closes requirement) and `spawn.py`'s `acceptance_gate` preflight; write-scope/phase-1-must-not-close portions remain CI-supplement (`plan-aware-closes-gate.yml`, not shipped to consumers in this delivery) |
| `pr_reference.py` | contract | phase-2 Closes/Fixes/Resolves requirement enforced zero-install by `contract-guard.sh` |
| `closure_sweep.py` | contract (single-PR case) / **contract, orchestrator-loop** (board-wide case) | single-PR closing-keyword act folds into `contract-guard.sh`; board-wide drift detection is now called each `spawn.py:roster_watchdog()` tick via `find_violations()`, reversing the 2026-08-07 out-of-scope ruling for this row per issue #464's ADR. Issue #512 requirement 4: `accumulation_trend()` also runs each tick (via the same `spawn.py:_board_wide_sweep()` call site), an advisory (non-blocking) count report of shape-1/shape-5 instance totals in the merged tree vs. the previous tick — compensates for the authoring-time hooks' local-diff-only visibility with a board-wide, cross-session view |
| `acceptance_gate.py` | contract | enforced zero-install via `spawn.py` preflight (`require_acceptance_gate`), before a phase-2 session starts |
| `landing_readiness.py` | contract, CI-supplement | advisory scope-overlap/checks judgment; not folded into `contract-guard.sh` in this delivery, remains CI-only where installed |
| `claim_scan.py` | contract, zero-install-hooked, CI-supplement | issue #476 H1: scans a record/PR body for claim-language ("reproduced"/"verified"/…) with no adjacent runnable evidence or no traceable target — CLI wrapper reads `gh pr diff`, still CI-only for target-traceability; issue #476 round 2 (H1b): `CLAIM_RE`/`EVIDENCE_MARKER_RE`/fence-adjacency (evidence presence only, no target traceability) ported inline into `on-the-record/hooks/claim-scan-preflight.sh`, a `PreToolUse`+`Bash` hook on `gh pr create`/`gh pr edit` joining `pr-preflight.sh`'s matcher group — warn-only (`additionalContext`, never blocks) pending the H1b flip-to-deny measurement window, zero-install, ships with the plugin |
| `reexecution_gate.py` | contract, CI-supplement | new (issue #476 H1): SHA-pinned worktree re-execution of a claim-adjacent command, gate-owned verdict written to `.reexecution/<issue>-<role>.json`, never role-writable; feeds `landing_readiness.reexecution_blocking_cause()`, folded into `landing_readiness.py`'s existing CI-supplement path — same boundary, no new install surface |
| `spawn_coverage.py` | **contract, orchestrator-loop** | "an issue was filed but no session ever started" is now checked each `spawn.py:roster_watchdog()` tick via `find_uncovered()`, including on an empty live roster, reversing the 2026-08-07 out-of-scope ruling for this row per issue #464's ADR |
| `repo_scope.py` | repo-local | issue #415: flags an unscoped capability/contract absence claim in issue/record prose; ships as a standalone script/pytest module, not wired into any zero-install preflight or `contract-guard.sh` |
| `accumulation.py` | repo-local | issue #424: flags a proposal touching a named accumulation-prone shape (inline subprocess/gh call-site growth, `roles/*.json`-style repeated one-line edits) with no `## Accumulation` line; checks this repo's own proposal-authoring practice, not wired into any consumer-reachable preflight. Issue #512: strengthened from heading-existence to heading-plus-non-empty-body (still presence-only, contract §14); the same check is also now reachable on consumer target repos via `accumulation-claim-guard.sh` (row above) |
| `issue_bundling.py` | repo-local | this org's own filing hygiene; `run.md` states no such obligation on a consumer's role sessions |
| `skip_gate.py` | repo-local | wraps this repo's own CI invocation of its own test suite |
| `spec_index.py` | repo-local | checks this repo's own `docs/specs/` set, not a consumer's |
| `risk_report.py` | contract | issue #511: `batch_blocked()`'s four-axis dominant-axis rule is enforced zero-install via `on-the-record/hooks/impact-guard.sh`, which denies a batch-merge Bash command; `classify()`/`report()` remain the non-blocking review-surface feed they always were |
| `gates.py` | n/a (infrastructure) | router/dispatcher to the modules above |
| `flows.py` | repo-local | feeds this repo's own status-board UI |
| `claims.py` | repo-local | new (#377): opt-in `# CLAIM-CHECK:` marker checker over this repo's own source (role-JSON enum drift, `spec.md`-producer claim); registered in `gates.ALL`, not wired into `gates/ci.py`'s required path in this delivery — promotion to required-check status is a separate follow-up decision per the proposal's own Rationale |
| `approval_request_shape.py` | contract | `missing_approval_clauses` is a testable extraction of the clause logic already enforced zero-install by `stop-gate.sh` (#411/#318); `has_generator_section` (#363) is presence-only and not wired into a blocking hook — `run.md` instructs its use, not a hook |
| `open_work.py` | contract, CI-supplement | `build_open_work_query` (#379) builds the lookup query only; the actual open-issue/open-PR check runs manually per `run.md`'s instruction, not via a blocking hook in this delivery |
| `record_lint.py` | contract | new (issue #517): `lint_record(path)` aggregates every `gates.py` record check plus the four checks lifted out of `record-claim-guard.sh`'s inline mirror against one record's full text; `record-claim-guard.sh` and `gates/ci.py` call into this module instead of duplicating the logic — zero-install (CLI + importable), ships with the plugin |
| `role_spec_shape.py` | contract | new (issue #521): hand-rolled shape checker (no `jsonschema` dependency) for `roles/specs/<name>.spec.json` against `docs/specs/role-spec-template.schema.json`'s shape; also exposes `record_path_role`/`reference_resolution_check`, called by `role-spec-reference-guard.sh`; `gates/test_role_spec_shape.py` (pytest, `-k "spec"`) loads and validates the 6 batch-1 files — zero-install (CLI + importable), ships with the plugin |
| `ui_evidence_gate.py` | repo-local | new (issue #685): `check_record`/`is_ui_facing` are pure functions wired only as `ui_evidence_gate_gate` in `gates.ALL`, via `gates.py`; not called from `gates/ci.py`'s actual `check()` graph (confirmed by `ci_reachable_gates`'s own reachability scan) and not ported into any `on-the-record/hooks/*.sh` preflight — registered but not yet reachable by any consumer-facing enforcement path, same class as `claims.py` below; promotion to a reachable check is a separate follow-up decision |
| `remediation_spawn.py` | contract | new (issue #587): `pending_remediation_tasks` is reachable zero-install via `run.md`'s own instructed step (`python3 $ON_THE_RECORD/gates/remediation_spawn.py --issue <n> -C <repo>`), run directly by every consumer's orchestrator session — not wired into a `PreToolUse`/`Stop` hook or `gates/ci.py`, same not-a-hook pattern as `approval_request_shape.py`'s `has_generator_section` above (`run.md` instructs its use, not a hook) |

## `on-the-record/hooks/*.sh` (plugin-shipped)

| mechanism | verdict | reason |
|---|---|---|
| `contract-guard.sh` | contract | new (#441): `PreToolUse`+`Bash`, intercepts `gh pr merge` before it executes; zero-install, ships with the plugin |
| `pr-preflight.sh` | contract | new (#459): `PreToolUse`+`Bash`, intercepts `gh pr create`/`gh pr edit` before the PR body is set, denying a wrong Closes/plain-`#n` trailer for the phase; ports `pr_reference.check_body`/`flows._plan_from_body` inline (zero-install), ships with the plugin |
| `claim-scan-preflight.sh` | contract | new (#476 round 2, H1b): `PreToolUse`+`Bash`, joins `pr-preflight.sh`'s matcher group on `gh pr create`/`gh pr edit`, scans the extracted `--body`/`--body-file` text for claim language with no adjacent runnable evidence; ports `claim_scan.py`'s `CLAIM_RE`/`EVIDENCE_MARKER_RE`/fence-adjacency inline (zero-install, evidence presence only, no target traceability); warn-only (`additionalContext` + mirrored stderr, exit 0) pending the H1b flip-to-deny window (two weeks, >=60% correction rate to flip to `exit 2`), ships with the plugin |
| `spec-index-preflight.sh` | contract | new (#459): `PreToolUse`+`Bash`, intercepts `git commit` before it lands, denying a staged spec-index-tracked file whose content changed without a matching index regen in the same staged set; ports `spec_index.parse_index` inline (zero-install), ships with the plugin |
| `deliverable-guard.sh` | contract | already shipped; blocks orchestrator-authored deliverables |
| `directive.sh` | contract | already shipped; `UserPromptSubmit` role directive injection |
| `stop-gate.sh` | contract | already shipped; `Stop` hook |
| `record-claim-guard.sh` | contract | new (#457): `PreToolUse`+`Write|Edit|MultiEdit`, session-side write-time mirror of `gates.py`'s record-claim-integrity checks (#310/#330/#331/#332/#333); zero-install, ships with the plugin |
| `role-test-claim-guard.sh` | contract | new (#457): `Stop`, role-session mirror of `gates/skip_gate.py` (#334) and the stub/full-suite integrity lesson behind #435, applied to the reply's own pasted test output; zero-install, ships with the plugin |
| `self-update.sh` | contract | already shipped; `SessionStart` plugin refresh |
| `decision-queue-stopgate.sh` | contract | new (#466): `Stop` hook, surfaces aged `decision_queue` items (>=1h nudge, >=4h block); zero-install, ships with the plugin |
| `impact-guard.sh` | contract | new (#511): `PreToolUse`+`Bash`, denies a Bash command batching 2+ `gh pr merge` calls when the target repo's own open proposals include one requiring individual approval (`docs/specs/impact-classification.md`'s dominant-axis rule); zero-install, ships with the plugin |
| `report-framing-check.sh` | contract | new (#320): `Stop`, checks a PR/board report turn's `last_assistant_message` for the four semantic-effect framing elements (resolved problem, prior cost, newly possible, still broken); zero-install, ships with the plugin, appended to the existing `Stop` array (declared first by `stop-gate.sh`) |
| `retry-loop-bound.sh` | contract | new (#507): `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` on `Write|Edit|MultiEdit|Bash`, bounds identical-refusal retry loops at K/2K denials per `sha256(tool_name, target)` signature (allow-with-context in `[K, 2K)`, deny outright at `>= 2K`); zero-install, ships with the plugin |
| `call-shape-guard.sh` | contract | new (#512): `PreToolUse`+`Write|Edit|MultiEdit` on `.py` writes, session-side mirror of `gates.py`'s `subprocess_call_shape_divergence` (repo-wide, `git ls-files`-scoped) and `sibling_mention_check` (diff-scoped to the write, checked against the local working-tree branch record) — issue #419 checks, unreachable since `gates/ci.py`'s runner was retired (#460); zero-install, ships with the plugin, root discovered by walking up from `cwd` |
| `role-spec-reference-guard.sh` | contract | new (issue #521): `PreToolUse`+`Write|Edit|MultiEdit`, denies a write to one of the 6 batch-1 verification-family roles' own record file (`docs/issue-<n>/reports/<role>.md`) whose new content carries a backtick-quoted relative path that does not resolve in the working tree — enforces each of those roles' `roles/specs/<name>.spec.json` `reference_resolution.rule`; delegates to `gates/role_spec_shape.py`'s `record_path_role`/`reference_resolution_check`, same zero-install pattern as `record-claim-guard.sh`, ships with the plugin |
| `accumulation-claim-guard.sh` | contract | new (#512): `PreToolUse`+`Write|Edit|MultiEdit` on `.py` writes, session-side mirror of `accumulation.py`'s `check_accumulation_claim` (issue #424), strengthened to field-presence (non-empty `## Accumulation` body, not just heading-existence); zero-install, ships with the plugin, root discovered by walking up from `cwd`; if no proposal file exists yet on disk this hook does not block |
| `record-scaffold.sh` | repo-local | new (issue #517): CLI-invoked (not a `PreToolUse` hook — no natural lifecycle event to hang it off, per a warrant-hunter finding on the phase-1 proposal), generates a `docs/issue-<n>/reports/<role>.md` skeleton with `PLACEHOLDER:` tokens; not wired into `hooks.json` |
| `delegated-judgment-gate.sh` | contract | new (issue #573): `PreToolUse`+`Bash`, auto-approves/auto-rejects a candidate decision only when both the depth axis (derives from an operator judgment recorded under `docs/product/*.md`) and the mechanical impact axis clear AND the multi-role panel reaches quorum and synthesizes under the fixed `panel-unanimous-support-v1` rule; any missing precondition escalates (no OR fallback, no special-case branch for an empty `docs/product` corpus); zero-install, ships with the plugin |
| `product-capture-stopgate.sh` | contract | new (issue #566): `Stop` hook, nudges the orchestrator session to record requirements/priorities/philosophy/goals stated during the conversation into `docs/product/<category>.md` when a category was flagged but the corresponding doc file gained no new line; advisory only (`additionalContext`, never `decision:"block"`); zero-install, ships with the plugin |
| `role-axis-completeness-guard.sh` | contract | new (issue #650, hunt #628 finding): `PreToolUse`+`Bash`, denies a `git commit` when the staged+working-tree `roles/*.json` set has an axis owned by zero or by more than one role, or a role's own `judgment_axes` shape is invalid; wires a real caller onto `gates/role_spec_shape.py`'s `check_axis_ownership`/`check_role_judgment_axes` (issue-573), which had been unit-tested with zero operational caller; fails open on environment gaps (missing `python3`/`git`, no candidate module exposing both functions, not a `git commit`, no staged `roles/*.json`), fails closed only on a positively-determined axis-completeness failure; zero-install, ships with the plugin |
| `plan-order-guard.sh` | contract | new (issue #659): `PreToolUse`+`Bash`, denies a spawn/merge for a plan step before its declared prerequisite step is done, per the issue body's `## 실행 계획` (`gates/flows.py:plan_order_blocked()`/`_plan_from_body()`); zero-install, ships with the plugin |
| `session-role-bind.sh` | contract | new (issue #698): `SessionStart`, snapshots `CLAUDE_ROLE` into a session_id-keyed state file before any session-controlled code runs, so `approval-gate.sh` (and future consumers) can trust a pre-session read instead of a later, model-influenced env-var read; first-observation wins, fail-open on missing `CLAUDE_ROLE`/`session_id`; zero-install, ships with the plugin |
| `approval-gate.sh` | contract | new (issue #608): `PreToolUse`+`Write|Edit|MultiEdit`, role-session-only (no-ops unless `CLAUDE_ROLE` is set), denies a phase-2-shaped write (the acting role's own `docs/issue-<n>/reports/<role>.md`, or a `src/`/`test(s)/` path) unless `docs/specs/approvers.md` is present AND a matching `APPROVE issue-<n>/<role>` issue comment from a listed account exists; absent `approvers.md` denies with a refuse-and-instruct (bootstrap-offer) message rather than a silent allow. Closes the coverage hole step 1's fixture measurement confirmed (`docs/issue-608/reports/execution-observation/fixture-measurement.md`, Findings 1-2): the only prior approval checks (`contract-guard.sh`, `pr-preflight.sh`) are both `Bash`-matcher, gated on `gh pr` verbs only, never reached by a plain file write. Branch-name parse failure (detached HEAD, non-issue branch) fails open, matching `pr-preflight.sh`/`contract-guard.sh`'s existing policy; a `gh` lookup failure also fails open (infrastructure failure, not an approval-state failure). Zero-install, ships with the plugin |

## `.github/workflows/*.yml` (retired, issue #460)

The operator ruled (2026-08-08, issue #460) that this repo's own CI red-X
checks — including its own — are retired: all enforcement lives in the
shipped hook surface plus locally runnable gate commands. `.github/workflows/`
is deleted; the table below is the migration record `gates/test_boundary.py`
(via `test_boundary_workflow_migration.py`) checks against, not a listing of
files that still exist.

| mechanism | verdict | replacement |
|---|---|---|
| `on-the-record-tests.yml` | repo-local, deleted | locally runnable `python3 -m pytest` (or `pytest -q`), run by hand or by the orchestrator loop before landing, per the no-mock "build it, run it" phase-2 bar; no shipped hook can run the suite (hooks fire on tool-use events inside a session, not on a schedule or PR event) |
| `plan-aware-closes-gate.yml` | repo-local, deleted | `--closes-only` step: zero-install `on-the-record/hooks/contract-guard.sh` + `spawn.py`'s `acceptance_gate` preflight (see `ci.py` row above). Full-bundle step (write_scope/protected-path/deps/`record_checked_claims`): no zero-install replacement; existing `contract, CI-supplement` drop, runnable locally as `python3 gates/ci.py . --pr <n> --autodetect` |
| `closure-sweep.yml` | repo-local, deleted | single-PR case: zero-install `contract-guard.sh` (see `closure_sweep.py` row above). Board-wide case: now `contract, orchestrator-loop` via `spawn.py:roster_watchdog()` (issue #464 ADR), also runnable locally as `python3 gates/closure_sweep.py` |
| `issue-bundling-gate.yml` | repo-local, deleted | no replacement possible — issue-creation is a GitHub webhook event, unreachable by any Claude Code session hook; runnable locally as `python3 gates/issue_bundling.py <issue#>` |

## `spawn.py`

| mechanism | verdict | reason |
|---|---|---|
| `spawn.py` | contract | not marketplace-shipped, but every caller (including consumers) runs this exact file directly — no per-consumer copy to go stale; carries `require_board`/`require_no_repo_config`/`require_acceptance_gate` preflights |

## Consumer-readable extract

`on-the-record/UNENFORCED-CLAUSES.md` (issue #452) is the derived,
gate-checked extract of this file's `contract, CI-supplement` and
`out of scope — operator decision` rows, shipped inside the deployed
`on-the-record/` tree so a consumer session can read it zero-install.
`gates/test_boundary.py` fails the build if it drifts from this file.

## Reachable vs. unreached by the zero-install baseline

See `docs/issue-441/proposals/2026-08-07-contract-enforcement-boundary.md`
("Reachable vs. unreached" table) for the full act-by-act breakdown. In
summary: a Claude Code session's `gh pr merge`/`git push` and opening a
phase-2 session are reached with zero installation. A human merging or
closing via the GitHub web UI, or a person running `gh`/`git` from a plain
terminal outside any Claude Code session, are not reached by anything in
this delivery — genuinely unreached, not solved, per #310. Board-wide
drift detection is out of scope per the operator decision above, so it is
not "unreached" in that sense — there is no obligation for it here.
